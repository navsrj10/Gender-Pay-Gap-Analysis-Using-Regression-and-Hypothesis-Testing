# Employee Salary Analysis Using Statistical Methods

## Overview

This project is a statistical analysis of employee salary data aimed at understanding compensation patterns and identifying meaningful differences in pay. It applies mathematical and statistical techniques to analyze how various factors influence salaries in a real-world workforce dataset.

---

## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to study employee salary trends and determine whether factors such as gender, experience, and job role have a significant impact on compensation. The analysis is data-driven and focuses on drawing valid conclusions using statistical evidence rather than assumptions.

## Approach

The project follows a structured analytical approach:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing and categorical values
* Exploratory data analysis to understand salary distributions
* Hypothesis testing to check whether observed salary differences are statistically significant
* Regression analysis to quantify the impact of different factors on salary
* Visualization of results to support insights and conclusions
